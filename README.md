# Encoder-Decoder Neural_nets

For your understanding, I'll quickly give the connection between Sequence-to-Sequence models and Encoder-Decoder architecture:

Sequence-to-sequence models and encoder-decoder architectures are closely related concepts, and often the terms are used interchangeably to describe the same idea. Let's delve into the connection between these two concepts:

Sequence-to-Sequence Models:

A sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model is a type of neural network architecture designed to handle input and output sequences of varying lengths. This architecture is particularly useful when the input and output data have different lengths and cannot be aligned one-to-one, like in translation tasks (e.g., translating English sentences to French sentences).


Encoder-Decoder Architecture:
The encoder-decoder architecture is a specific implementation of sequence-to-sequence models. It consists of two main components: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder processes the input sequence and generates a fixed-size context vector that encapsulates the important information from the input. The decoder then takes this context vector and generates the output sequence step by step.
